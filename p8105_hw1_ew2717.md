## Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(10)

data_table <- tibble(
  my_variable = rnorm(10),
  logical_vec = my_variable > 0,
  ten_char_vector = c("c", "h", "a", "r", "a", "c", "t", "e", "r", "s"),
  three_levels = factor(c("one", "two", "three", "three", "two", "one", "one", "one", "three", "three"))
)

data_table
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    my_variable logical_vec ten_char_vector three_levels
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>           <fct>       
    ##  1      0.0187 TRUE        c               one         
    ##  2     -0.184  FALSE       h               two         
    ##  3     -1.37   FALSE       a               three       
    ##  4     -0.599  FALSE       r               three       
    ##  5      0.295  TRUE        a               two         
    ##  6      0.390  TRUE        c               one         
    ##  7     -1.21   FALSE       t               one         
    ##  8     -0.364  FALSE       e               one         
    ##  9     -1.63   FALSE       r               three       
    ## 10     -0.256  FALSE       s               three

``` r
mean(pull(data_table, my_variable))
```

    ## [1] -0.4906568

``` r
mean(pull(data_table, logical_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(data_table, ten_char_vector))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(data_table, three_levels))
```

    ## [1] NA

The mean of my\_variable and logical\_vec can be calculated because they
are numeric and logical vectors. ten\_char\_vector and three\_levels,
however, cannot have their means calculated because they are character
and factor vectors.

``` r
converted_num1 = as.numeric(pull(data_table, logical_vec))
converted_num2 = as.numeric(pull(data_table, ten_char_vector))
converted_num3 = as.numeric(pull(data_table, three_levels))
```

The logical and factor vectors can be converted to numeric values, while
the character value cannot be converted. We are unable to convert
characters or letters to numbers. For the logical vector, we are able to
convert it to numeric because 1 can represent TRUE and 0 can represent
FALSE.

``` r
mean(converted_num1)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(converted_num2)
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(converted_num3)
```

    ## [1] 1.8

After converting logical\_vec, ten\_char\_vector, and three\_levels to
numeric values, it is found that only ten\_char\_vector cannot be
converted. I could not convert the chracater vector into numeric
variables.

# Problem 2

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The names in this data set are: species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year.

The unique *species* in the data set are: Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap.

The unique *islands* in the data set are: Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream.

The unique *years* in the data set are: 2007, 2008, 2009.

The *sex* of the penguins in the data set are: male, female.

Important variables for *bill length* are shown in the table:

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   32.10   39.23   44.45   43.92   48.50   59.60       2

Important variables for *bill depth* are shown in the table:

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   13.10   15.60   17.30   17.15   18.70   21.50       2

Important variables for *body mass* are shown in the table:

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##    2700    3550    4050    4202    4750    6300       2

Important variables for *flipper length* are shown in the table:

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   172.0   190.0   197.0   200.9   213.0   231.0       2

As seen above, the mean flipper length is 200.9, which is rounded to
201.

There are 344 *rows* and 8 *columns* in this data set.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_ew2717_files/figure-gfm/create%20scatter%20plot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggtitle("Flipper versus Bill Length")
```

    ## $title
    ## [1] "Flipper versus Bill Length"
    ## 
    ## attr(,"class")
    ## [1] "labels"

This is the scatter plot for Flipper versus Bill Length.

``` r
ggsave("penguin_scatter_plot.pdf", plot = last_plot(), height = 4, width = 6)
```

This saves the scatter plot as a pdf file names penguin\_scatter\_plot.
